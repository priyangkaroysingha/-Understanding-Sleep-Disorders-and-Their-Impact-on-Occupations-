# -Understanding-Sleep-Disorders-and-Their-Impact-on-Occupations-
## Overview
This Tableau project delves into comprehensive datasets on sleep disorders, focusing on their impact across different occupations. The project aims to uncover insights into factors affecting sleep disorders, potential improvements, and the impact on various job roles.
## Scope and Key Focus Areas
The analysis focuses on three key areas: Factors Affecting Sleep Disorders, Potential Improvements to Overcome Sleep Disorders, and Impact Sleep Disorders Have on Different Occupations. These areas delve into the distribution of sleep disorders, gender differences, age differences and the impact on specific occupations.
## Methodology
The project utilizes Python for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of sleep disorders and prepare the dataset for visualization. Tableau Public is employed for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards that illustrate insights derived from Python's analysis, including sleep disorder proportions, gender differences, and impacts across various occupations. Both Python and Tableau facilitate data transformation and categorization to deepen the understanding of factors influencing sleep disorders.
## Data Sources
Primary data sources for this project are sourced from Kaggle, focusing on surveys and studies related to sleep disorders. These datasets encompass variables such as occupation, stress levels, sleep quality, and various health metrics. They are selected to provide comprehensive insights into the prevalence and impact of sleep disorders across different demographics and occupational groups.
## Tools Used
1. Tableau Public: Utilized for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
2. Excel: Employed for initial data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.
3. Python: Used specifically for more advanced data preprocessing steps.
## Dashboard Overview
The Sleep Disorders and Occupations dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the distribution and impact of sleep disorders. Visualizations include:
1. Proportion of Sleep Disorders
2. Gender and Age Insights
3. Sleep Disorder vs.Avg. Quality Of Sleep, Stress Level and Sleep Duration 
4. Occupation-Specific Analysis
5. Correlation Relation between Quality of Sleep Vs Physical Activity Level and Daily Steps
6. Relation between Stress Level and Sleep Duration
7. Sleep Disorder By Occupation
8. Stress Level by Occupation
## Findings
Through visualizations, we uncovered key insights into the primary factors influencing sleep disorders. Specifically, our findings highlight that factors such as Quality of Sleep, Stress Levels, Sleep Duration, Blood Pressure, and Body Weight significantly impact sleep disorders. Nurses were found to have the highest prevalence of sleep disorders, while sales representatives exhibited the highest stress levels among occupational groups. This analysis underscores the importance of increasing physical activity, improving sleep duration and quality, and reducing stress levels to mitigate the risk of sleep disorders.
## Conclusion
Our analysis reveals significant insights into the factors contributing to sleep disorders, highlighting the critical roles of sleep quality, stress levels, and health metrics like blood pressure and body weight. Nurses showed the highest prevalence of sleep disorders, with sales representatives exhibiting notably elevated stress levels. Addressing these factors through targeted interventions such as promoting better sleep hygiene and reducing stress could mitigate the impact of sleep disorders, enhancing overall well-being and productivity in affected populations.
## Recommendation
1. Implement workplace policies and educational programs to establish consistent sleep schedules and improve sleep environments.
2. Offer targeted stress reduction programs, especially for high-stress occupations.
3. Promote regular exercise among employees to enhance sleep quality and overall health.
4. Provide routine health checks focusing on blood pressure, body weight, and relevant health metrics to monitor and improve employee health.
